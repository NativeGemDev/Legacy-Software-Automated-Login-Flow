# Legacy Software Automated Login Flow

## Overview

This project is designed to help users understand how to initiate the web GUI interface for their desktop automation flows, specifically targeting legacy software systems. By automating the login process, this project enables users to seamlessly begin their workflows in any legacy desktop environment, allowing them to focus on subsequent automation steps.

## Project Details

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to provide a foundational flow that demonstrates how to initiate the web GUI interface for logging into legacy software. This automated login process ensures that users can quickly and efficiently start their workflows, regardless of the outdated or cumbersome nature of the login interfaces. GitHub.comâ€™s login interface is used as an example, but this flow can be adapted to work with various legacy systems.

### Key Features

- **Web GUI Initiation:** Provides a template for initiating the web-based GUI for legacy software.
- **Automated Login:** Inputs user credentials and automates the login process.
- **Error Handling:** Manages potential issues during login, such as incorrect credentials.
- **Flexible Framework:** The flow is designed to be the first step in any legacy desktop automation process.

### Flow Components

1. **Web GUI Initialization:**
   - Launches the web-based login interface for the target legacy software.
   - Prepares the interface for automated interactions.

2. **Credential Input:**
   - Securely stores and retrieves login credentials.
   - Automates the input of username and password fields.

3. **Login Submission:**
   - Submits the login form automatically.
   - Includes wait times to handle varying response times of different systems.

4. **Error Detection and Handling:**
   - Detects login errors and provides feedback.
   - Options for retrying the login or reporting issues.

5. **Post-Login Workflow (Optional):**
   - Placeholder for adding additional automation steps after the login process.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the desktop flow in Power Automate Desktop.
3. Update the login credentials in the secure storage.
4. Run the flow to initiate the web GUI and log into the legacy system.
5. (Optional) Customize the flow to include additional steps for your specific workflow.

### Requirements

- Power Automate Desktop installed on your machine.
- Access to the legacy software's web-based login interface.
- Valid credentials for logging into the system.

### Customization

This flow is intended as a template for initiating the web GUI in any legacy desktop automation project. To customize it for your specific needs:

1. Update the web selectors to match your target system's login interface.
2. Adjust wait times and error handling logic based on system behavior.
3. Add additional steps in the flow to perform further actions post-login.
